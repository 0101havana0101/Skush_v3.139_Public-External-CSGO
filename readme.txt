To use simply open the exe and login with your mpgh account.
To use cfg's navigate to the far right tab (settings) and select the files that are listed (note that all cfgs are pulled from the configs folder so place any cfg's you have in there)
The rest is pretty self explanitory, remember to have fun and dont get caught!
